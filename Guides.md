# Dwarf Fortress Guides #

## Definitions ##

*Level*: The skill level of the guide's audience.

Level | Description
------------ | -------------
Beginner | A complete beginner, you have never played Dwarf Fortress before or perhaps have tried it briefly and gave it up.  Much of the guide will talk about UI and how to interact with the game to get things done.
Intermediate | You have some experience with Dwarf Fortress, but have not explored much of its complexity. The UI does not scare you, but you don't have muscle memory for a lot of it. Less emphasis UI instruction (key presses and screens included for clarity or reminder), more on seeing the bigger picture.  
Expert | You have experience with all of the systems within the game, but you are looking for interesting strategies.  You are an expert with the UI, so there will be little or no instruction on keys, screens, or selection. 
Guru | You have a deep understanding of all of the mechanisms and are looking for more/different Fun (challenging embarks, weird handicaps, etc).  Game concepts are all known, these are essentially meta-guides creating new games from the game.

*DFv*: The version of Dwarf Fortress that the guide was written for and tested with.

Complete | The guide is complete. It might get typo-corrections or have minor edits for correction and readability, but it is complete.
