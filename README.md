## License ##

This repository is licensed CC-BY-4.0 (as described in the LICENSE.md document).  You can use it however you want, but you must include attribution for the authors and editors. However, if an individual guide has a more restrictive license, it will be listed in a "LICENSE.md" file within the subfolder of that guide.  These may have more stringent requirements (non-commercial, etc).  When in doubt, the most specific license should be considered authoritative for the content.
