Putting it all together
-----------------------

Whew! That about covers it. It's a hugely complex system to try to get
to grips with all at once. Giving an exact order of actions is
difficult, but here's my recommendation for priorities:

1.  Secure the entrance with the walls, roof and bridge
2.  Install clean/secure water supply and begin farming
3.  Make still and start brewing
4.  Start gathering plants
5.  Carpentry
6.  Kitchen

However, whenever you find dwarves standing idle, make sure you put them
to work on the next item.

Your fort is pretty well secure and self-sufficient at this point. Next,
we'll talk about some basic amenities to keep your dwarves happy and
healthy, further beefing your defences and securing indoor supplies of
food and wood, trading, and the complex joys of allocating labours as
your fortress attracts migrants. Such fun.
