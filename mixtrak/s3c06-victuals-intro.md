Victuals
--------

Dwarves have hearty appetites for food and (especially) booze. Let's
talk rationing: dwarves require about two units of
[Food](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Food "wikilink") and five of [Alcohol](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Alcohol "wikilink") per
season, and the [default embark](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Embark#Supplies "wikilink") loadout
gives you 60 units of alcohol (60 / 5 / 7 = 1.7143 seasons) and 45 units
of food (45 / 2/ 7 = 3.2143 seasons). Clearly, it's best not to tarry
setting up a food industry.

### Sure as Eggs

Fortunately, although there's a significant lag before farms will
produce goods, we can begin producing food and booze immediately thanks
to our herbalist and our trusty egg-layers. And remember, if things go
pear-shaped and you do happen to encounter a severe food shortage, you
shouldn't hesitate to butcher your pack animals. That's not difficult,
but not covered here.

The victuals industry will occupy another quadrant of our three-layer
setup. First, in one of the medium rooms off the corridor, make a
pasture and assign your blue peafowl, then build enough nest box(es) for
the female(s). The returns on animal breeding compound so you may as
well start right away, but that means you'll need to prevent your
dwarves harvesting the eggs and let them hatch. Get your mason to build
a door, place it in the doorway to the nesting room, and toggle the
door's “keep tightly closed” option to on, so your peafowl can't escape.
Then, once they and the next boxes are all inside, toggle “forbid
passage” to on, so your dwarves can't get through. The eggs will
incubate safely away from the hungry hands of you dwarves, and
eventually you'll have a clutch of new peafowl. Un-forbid the door,
build enough new nest boxes to accommodate the new females, rinse and
repeat. When you're ready to switch from breeding into egg production,
then just un-forbid the door and your dwarves will harvest the eggs as
they are laid, and before they have a chance to hatch. Peachicks grow to
adulthood (and full size) after only a year, at which point the females
will begin laying and you can butcher all but one of the males. A
handful of laying females - five or so - should provide more than enough
eggs to supplement your diet, but if you wish to expand your flock even
further then you may need a larger room, so the animals don't get
overcrowded and start attacking one another.
