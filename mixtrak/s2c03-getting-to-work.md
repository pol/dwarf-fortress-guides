Getting to work
---------------

You can unpause the game now.

- ⇨ Unpause the game.

Your miners should dig this out pretty quickly, especially if you have a
few layers of soil so they're not digging straight down into rock.
Still, after deconstructing the wagon and pasturing the livestock your
other dwarves may find themselves milling about while they wait for the
miners. Resist the urge to assign them busy-work such as chopping trees
or collecting plants - that will come soon enough. But there *are* some
jobs which should absolutely be done as soon as possible.

#### Guard Dogs

Once the first level of the stairwell is complete, build two ropes as restraints on the diagonal extending out from the inner corner and assign one of your war dogs to each rope. They can roam within 1 tile of the restraint, but no configuration leaves a gap for anything to sneak through:

- ⇨ Build 2x `Restraint`s (`wool ropes`)
- ⇨ Assign one male and one female `war dog` to the `wool ropes`.

#### Temporary Workshops

Once the cart is deconstructed, make a `Carpenter's Workshop` from one
of the logs. We will also need a `Metalsmith's Forge` (temporarily using our anvil) and a `Wood Furnace` to eventually build our gate. It's not too imporant where these go, they can be on the surface or, if things are looking dicey, in the stairwell. These are temporary, so it doesn't really matter where they go. By the time we get to ordering their construction, your miners should have some stone available to use.

- ⇨ Build a temporary `Carpenter's Workshop`
- ⇨ Build a temporary `Metalsmith's Forge`
- ⇨ Build a temporary `Wood Furnace`

Once the `Carpenter's Workshop` is built, use that to make a wooden hatch from another log. Install the hatch over your one-tile, surface-level entrance.Congratulations! You now have a lockable front door. It won't stop thieves and building destroyers, but at least you can exclude a fair bit of dangerous stuff.

- ⇨ Build a wooden `Hatch Cover` at the `Carpenter's Workshop` and install over the entrance channel.

If you've done all this and your miners still have a long ways to go, by
all means designate a few nearby trees for felling and/or plants for
gathering while you wait, but don't get carried away. You'll want a
small, temporary stockpile nearby for the wood and food.  You could also set the Carpenter's Workshop to make a few beds from the logs.

- ⇨ Designate some trees for woodcutting
- ⇨ Designate some plants for gathering
- ⇨ Create a 4x4 food, wood, and finished goods surface stockpile

Soon, however, your miners should be finished with the large 11 x 11
room. Pause the game and fill the room with an “everything stockpile”
for food, cloth, furniture, finished goods, and every other category of
goods you brought with you. Exclude stone (which will just clutter it
up), refuse and corpses (which will cause other objects to decay!).
Remove any temporary stockpiles on the surface (except the corpse/refuse
pile).

- ⇨ Create an everything stockpile in the 11x11 room (exclude `Stone`, `Wood`, `Refuse`, `Corpses`)

Then, in the same room, designate a 3 x 3 pasture and assign your blue
peafowl, to keep them safely inside. It's bad to crowd animals, as they
get aggressive, but unless you brought a bunch more non-grazing animals
this small pasture should be enough. Finally, in the same room,
designate an 8 x 8 zone for a meeting area which does not overlap with
the pasture (again, crowding animals = bad). Idle dwarves will
congregate here, safely underground. You can leave the cat without a
pasture - it should mostly prowl around your stockpiled food, protecting
it from vermin.

- ⇨ Create a 3x3 `Pasture/Pen` zone in the 11x11 room. Assign the peahens and peacocks to it.
- ⇨ Create an 8x8 `Meeting Area` zone in the 11x11 room.

Temporarily re-enable hauling labours on your miners so they can help
bring stuff inside, cancel any wood-cutting or plant-gathering
designations, and unpause. Your dwarves should rush
to get everything into the stockpile. When that's done, you can pause
again, and once again disable hauling for your miners.

- ⇨ Pause the game.
- ⇨ Re-enable `Hauling` on the Miners
- ⇨ Disable `Woodcutting` and `Gathering`
- ⇨ Unpause the game until everything is hauled inside
- ⇨ Pause the game, disable `Hauling` on the Miners, next section!

<!-- is enabling hauling on the miners really necessary if we are going to make the farm next? -->

Soil Farming
------------

Instructions on making a farm in the soil level.

- ⇨  Designate an 11x11 room right off of the **second** ramp section with an `Up/Down Stair` in the very center.
- ⇨ Right above that, designate a `Down Stair`
- ⇨ Surrounding the `Down Stair`, designate four 3x4 rooms, each diagonally connected to the Down Stair.
- ⇨ Follow the section 3 guide to setting up the farms and the 11x11 room with workshops and stockpiles. 

Made it!
--------

Of course, things might not have gone to plan. If something arrives at
your fort and either a) it won't go away, so you can't safely access the
surface or b) it's a [Building Destroyer](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Building_Destroyer "wikilink")
and it's coming this way and *oh Armok it's breaking down the hatch…*
you'll have to engineer a more permanent solution. That's beyond the
scope of this guide because it constitutes a fairly substantial
deviation from The Plan, but the most general and powerful approach is
as follows.

First, protect yourself from building destroyers. First, make sure your
dwarves are all inside, then mine away the single up-ramp to the
surface, and replace it with a wall constructed of mining stone (you
should have some by now). Second, you need to engineer
[Cave-in](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Cave-in "wikilink") traps, then lure the thing(s) into them
and activate them. There's [a lot of ways to do this](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Trap_design#cave-in_trap "wikilink") but a word to the wise:
either make it so the traps and fortress access can be activated
remotely, from behind a walled-in fallback position, or *don't bloody
well miss*. Make more and bigger traps than you think you need,
especially if you might only get one shot. Once the dust has settled,
scrape the interloper off the geology and try to pick up where you left
off.

Worst case scenario, if you didn't heed my advice and find yourself in a
location where the surface is chronically unsafe, well, your best bet is
to try to make a home in the caverns and hope your seven dwarves really,
*really* like one another… but that's another section in this guide.
