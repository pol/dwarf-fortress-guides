So you've chosen your civilisation, your site, and your embark loadout.
You've arrived, and are ready to strike the earth. What should you do
first?

Get the hell inside.

Well, first *make* an inside, then get the hell in there. Dwarf Fortress
is one of those games where anything can happen, and it has no concept
of “fair”. It's perfectly possible to arrive at a nice-looking location
and for all your dwarves to be almost immediately slaughtered. The
danger could be wild beasts, bandits, the undead, hostile civilisations,
monsters, you name it. Fortunately, none of them can dig.

Checking for Threats
--------------------

So the first order of business is to pause the game (you *have* paused,
haven't you? Maybe go re-read the [Quickstart
Guide](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Quickstart_Guide "wikilink")…) and check your surroundings for
threats. On a nice embark, there should be nothing more exciting than
some fairly mundane wildlife.

If, however, there's anything more interesting on the prowl, you have
three options. The first is to proceed with your fortress, but do it
*really fast* and pray you get everything underground before the threat
spots you. The second, if it looks *particularly* interesting, is to run
like hell to the opposite edge of the map and do the same, which is
awkward (your supplies are all back in the middle of the map, and you'll
struggle without them), but can save your bacon. Make sure you take your
picks, at least, or you'll be well and truly buggered. The third is
all-out attack. Check what the wiki says about this particular threat
and decide accordingly. If you get sealed in without supplies, you may
have to make a race down to the caverns for food, and then find a way to
kill the threat because you won't get very far without your anvil or
access to the surface to trade for an anvil. There's some general
suggestions at the end of this page. 

However, assuming all goes well, it's time indeed to strike the earth...

Designating Layout
------------------

The first thing is to designate your wagon for removal, so you can use
its logs. This is a task for your carpenter, so don't go distracting
them with any tree-felling jobs or anything. Next, turn off your miners'
hauling labours - they need to focus!

Now before we start chucking things about it's important to make a plan
for where everything is going to go. Feel free to come up with your own
design, but there's a particular layout I'm going to recommend because
it's quite efficient, secure and flexible. I'll illustrate with
diagrams, each of which shows a bird's-eye view - that is, overseer
perspective - of a single layer.

First, count tiles to find the centre of the map. This is the location
of the central axis of your spiral ramp descending down into the
fortress, but don't dig right here. The entrance should be approximately
three tiles away, in any cardinal direction (north, south, east, west).
In these diagrams, I've chosen east. On that single tile, designate a
channel in the ground. That tile will flash with the underscore
character.

![](images/central_square_entrance.png "central_square_entrance.png")

Legend:

`C` = central map square (illustrative only)

`_` = channel tile for fort entrance

This instructs your miners create a down-ramp to the layer below. It's
also simple to adapt this design for tunnelling into the side of a
slope, but read ahead first to make sure you understand the principles.

A narrow entrance causes a little congestion, but is easier to seal up,
which is our current priority. Making a completely secure entrance will
come later, because it requires mechanics and other things we might not
have time for. For now, we just need to get underground, and batten down
the hatches as best we can.

Now we have some coordinates by which to orient ourselves, we need to
designate a few [stockpiles](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Stockpile "wikilink") and
[zones](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Zone "wikilink") nearby. First, find the nearest flowing water
tile and, on the single bank tile *adjacent* to the water tile,
designate a water source.

Next, you'll need a combined stockpile for refuse and corpses (`r` in
the following diagram) and a pasture zone (`p`):

![](images/zones_stockpiles.png "zones_stockpiles.png")

Later, that gap in the bottom-right corner will hold your trade depot.
The refuse pile is necessary because dead matter stored underground will
[rot](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Miasma "wikilink"), which makes your dwarves unhappy. And the
pasture is - duh - so that your grazing animals don't starve for lack of
[Grass](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Grass "wikilink"). If your map doesn't have grass in the middle
here, you'll need to find some nearby. Go ahead and assign your sheep
(or other grazing animals) to that pasture zone.

Now it's time to go down a layer and designate the next set of digging,
which should look like this:

![](images/stairwell_1.png "stairwell_1.png")

Note that we're not mining directly under the channel - otherwise you
risk mining away the up-ramps which channels produce and your miners
will be stuck.

We actually are going to repeat this pattern, spiralling down, for a few
more layers. Generally, it's a good strategy to leave a buffer zone of
un-mined layers between the surface and your fort, for several reasons.
In the layer immediately under the surface, tree roots penetrate the
soil and leave gaps which are security vulnerabilities when the trees
are cut down. You can patch them up but eventually the whole roof of
soil will be replaced with paving, and that means no more trees or
plants for you to harvest. Also, undermining murky pools and rivers
results in annoying announcements and designation cancellations. You can
override these, but then you risk accidentally puncturing the roof and
flooding your fortress. But the final, and most important reason, is
flexibility. If you later want to dig a moat around your fortress
entrance, having a buffer of un-mined layers avoids annoying fortress
remodelling.

That said, I'd recommend repeating the spiral pattern until you're at
least five layers beneath the lowest water-point on the map. So the next
layer would look like so:

![](images/stairwell_2.png "stairwell_2.png")

And so on. This might seem like a lot more work than just digging a
shaft, but it has advantages:

-   If you want to bring trade wagons inside at some later point, they
    can get down the ramp
-   Falling dwarves fall right *through* stairs, but not ramps
-   The spiral design ensures that there's no consecutive layers of
    mined tiles on top of one another, which means falling stone won't
    punch a hole right down to the bottom of the shaft
-   Plenty of room for dwarves to move around and for any future needs
    (decoration, levers, temporary stockpiles etc.)

A little extra digging now will save you time and remodelling in the
long run. A stitch in time, as they say.

Once you're down deep enough (Again, I recommend using the 5th level
below the lowest water level on your map), we're ready to actually begin
digging the fortress blueprint. First, designate a large 11 x 11 room on
the next level down, centred on the central map tile:

![](images/central_room.png "central_room.png")

In that diagram and all diagrams going forward, I've replaced the
channelling designations with triangles pointing down, because that's
how they'll look when they're ramps. Similarly, completed up-ramps look
like up-triangles, but you don't have to designate these - they'll be
automatically created when the layer above gets channelled. Make sure
the location of up and down ramps on each level lines up! Those three
dark squares are un-designated because they provide support and are
necessary for the ramps to function. It's a little confusing, so go read
[Ramp](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Ramp "wikilink") and [Channel](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Channel "wikilink") if you're not
following.

You can unpause now.

Getting to work
---------------

Your miners should dig this out pretty quickly, especially if you have a
few layers of soil so they're not digging straight down into rock.
Still, after deconstructing the wagon and pasturing the livestock your
other dwarves may find themselves milling about while they wait for the
miners. Resist the urge to assign them busy-work such as chopping trees
or collecting plants - that will come soon enough. But there *are* some
jobs which should absolutely be done as soon as possible:

-   Once the first level of the stairwell is complete, build two ropes
    as restraints on the diagonal extending out from the inner corner,
    like so: ![](images/dog_placement.png "fig:dog_placement.png")
-   Then assign your one of your war dogs to each rope. They can roam
    within 1 tile of the restraint, but no configuration leaves a gap
    for anything to sneak through.
-   Once the cart is deconstructed, make a carpenter's workshop (on the
    surface or, if things are looking dicey, in the stairwell) from one
    of the logs, then use that to make a wooden hatch from another log.
    Install the hatch over your one-tile, surface-level entrance.
    Congratulations! You now have a lockable front door. It won't stop
    thieves and building destroyers, but at least you can exclude a fair
    bit of dangerous stuff.
-   You'll probably want to forbid the soap so your wasteful dwarves
    don't use it on such frippery as “personal hygiene”. That's for
    hospital use only, Urist!

If you've done all this and your miners still have a long ways to go, by
all means designate a few nearby trees for felling and/or plants for
gathering while you wait, but don't get carried away. You'll want a
small, temporary stockpile nearby for the wood and food.

Soon, however, your miners should be finished with the large 11 x 11
room. Pause the game and fill the room with an “everything stockpile”
for food, cloth, furniture, finished goods, and every other category of
goods you brought with you. Exclude stone (which will just clutter it
up), refuse and corpses (which will cause other objects to decay!).
Remove any temporary stockpiles on the surface (except the corpse/refuse
pile).

Then, in the same room, designate a 3 x 3 pasture and assign your blue
peafowl, to keep them safely inside. It's bad to crowd animals, as they
get aggressive, but unless you brought a bunch more non-grazing animals
this small pasture should be enough. Finally, in the same room,
designate an 8 x 8 zone for a meeting area which does not overlap with
the pasture (again, crowding animals = bad). Idle dwarves will
congregate here, safely underground. You can leave the cat without a
pasture - it should mostly prowl around your stockpiled food, protecting
it from vermin.

Temporarily re-enable hauling labours on your miners so they can help
bring stuff inside, cancel any wood-cutting or plant-gathering
designations, un-forbid the soap, and unpause. Your dwarves should rush
to get everything into the stockpile. When that's done, you can pause
again, re-forbid the soap, and once again disable hauling for your
miners.

Made it!
--------

Of course, things might not have gone to plan. If something arrives at
your fort and either a) it won't go away, so you can't safely access the
surface or b) it's a [Building Destroyer](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Building_Destroyer "wikilink")
and it's coming this way and *oh Armok it's breaking down the hatch…*
you'll have to engineer a more permanent solution. That's beyond the
scope of this guide because it constitutes a fairly substantial
deviation from The Plan, but the most general and powerful approach is
as follows.

First, protect yourself from building destroyers. First, make sure your
dwarves are all inside, then mine away the single up-ramp to the
surface, and replace it with a wall constructed of mining stone (you
should have some by now). Second, you need to engineer
[Cave-in](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Cave-in "wikilink") traps, then lure the thing(s) into them
and activate them. There's [a lot of ways to do this](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Trap_design#cave-in_trap "wikilink") but a word to the wise:
either make it so the traps and fortress access can be activated
remotely, from behind a walled-in fallback position, or *don't bloody
well miss*. Make more and bigger traps than you think you need,
especially if you might only get one shot. Once the dust has settled,
scrape the interloper off the geology and try to pick up where you left
off.

Worst case scenario, if you didn't heed my advice and find yourself in a
location where the surface is chronically unsafe, well, your best bet is
to try to make a home in the caverns and hope your seven dwarves really,
*really* like one another… but that's another section in this guide.
