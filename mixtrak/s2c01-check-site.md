So you've chosen your civilisation, your site, and your embark loadout.
You've arrived (and paused the game), and are ready to strike the earth. What should you do
first?

- ⇨ Pause the game!

Now, get the hell inside.

Well, first *make* an
[inside](Defense_guide#Inside_vs._outside "wikilink"), then get the hell
in there. Dwarf Fortress is one of those games where anything can
happen, and it has no concept of “fair”. It's perfectly possible to
arrive at a nice-looking location and for all your dwarves to be almost
immediately slaughtered. The danger could be wild beasts, bandits, the
undead, hostile civilisations, monsters, [you name
it](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Defense_guide#Threats "wikilink"). Fortunately, none of them can
dig. Now's a good time to skim the rest of that [Defense
guide](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Defense_guide "wikilink"), too.

Checking for Threats
--------------------

The earliest (indeed, potentially immediate) source of fun is dangerous
wild animals, so the first order of business is [check your
surroundings](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Quickstart_guide#Surveying_the_Area "wikilink") for
threats. Don't unpause! On a nice embark the animals will be
reassuringly mundane, though some of the [predators](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Tiger "wikilink")
and [larger species](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Rhinoceros "wikilink") are still quite willing and
able to send your fortress to an early grave, and others will
[pilfer](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Steals_items "wikilink") your supplies given the chance. In
savage surrounds, you should particularly beware 
[giant versions of usually-harmless critters](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Giant_kea "wikilink"). If in doubt, check the
wiki to assess the threat level.

Keeping tabs on the wildlife isn't much of an overhead, so you should
make a regular habit of checking what's on the prowl under “Other” in
the [Unit list](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Unit_list "wikilink"). Only one species of wild animal
will [appear](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Creature#Spawning "wikilink") on your map at a time,
usually in small groups, and hang around for quite a while (of the order
of months). Eventually, they'll wander off the edge and be replaced by
something potentially much 
[worse](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Ambusher#Caveats "wikilink"). In
addition, if there's nothing currently roaming the surface, don't become
complacent: rest assured, *something* will turn up before long.

If you have just arrived and there's already something scary on the map,
you basically have three options:

1.  Monitor the threat but just focus on getting underground: this works
    for animals which are unlikely to cause big problems, either because
    they aren't very aggressive, aren't very dangerous, or aren't likely
    to wander into proximity. It can be a sensible gamble, especially if
    you tweak this guide a little to get things underground even faster
    (e.g. using the entrance ramps as stockpiles as soon as they're
    ready).
2.  [Attack](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Attack "wikilink"): if the animals are likely to injure a
    lone dwarf but will be easily outmatched when you gang up on them,
    consider just dealing with them immediately. But remember, your
    dwarves will usually flee from attackers unless you recruit them to
    an active [Squad](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Squad "wikilink"), in which case - in typically
    self-contradictory dwarfish fashion - even utterly green recruits
    will dauntlessly pursue any and all aggressors until no longer
    capable of doing so. In doing so, it's common for them to bite off
    more than they can chew. So be warned: once they get scent of an
    enemy, you have essentially no control over your citizens, either
    due to craven cowardice or unquenchable bloodlust. Generally this is
    not a good approach - for your founding seven, most animals are
    either safely ignored or too dangerous to take on (given that even
    minor injuries can be lethal or crippling in the absence of a
    hospital), with not a lot in the middle. Low-level threats are
    usually best monitored and dealt with reactively, and as for
    high-level threats…
3.  Run away: run like hell to the opposite edge of the map and dig your
    entrance over there. If the threat is this serious, you'll probably
    have to leave at least some of your supplies behind, which is
    extremely awkward and not to be done lightly, but if a comprehensive
    massacre seems likely this *can* save your bacon. Just be sure to
    prioritise grabbing your picks, some food and booze, and your axe
    (which can be achieved by placing the appropriate stockpiles far
    from the threat), otherwise survival is *very* unlikely.

To decide among these options, conduct a threat assessment based on the
animal's number, aggressiveness, mobility and proximity (i.e.
probability of hostile encounter), fighting abilities and size. Be
guided by the wiki entry on the animal in question and - of course - a
healthy dose of paranoia. There's a little more info about how to deal
with threats at the end of this page.
