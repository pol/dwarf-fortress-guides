Getting to work
---------------

You can unpause the game now.

- Unpause the game.


Your miners should dig this out pretty quickly, especially if you have a
few layers of soil so they're not digging straight down into rock.
Still, after deconstructing the wagon and pasturing the livestock your
other dwarves may find themselves milling about while they wait for the
miners. Resist the urge to assign them busy-work such as chopping trees
or collecting plants - that will come soon enough. But there *are* some
jobs which should absolutely be done as soon as possible.

Once the first level of the stairwell is complete, build two ropes as restraints on the diagonal extending out from the inner corner, like so: 
![](images/dog_placement.png "fig:dog_placement.png")

- Build 2x `Restraint`s (`wool ropes`)

-   Then assign your one of your war dogs to each rope. They can roam
    within 1 tile of the restraint, but no configuration leaves a gap
    for anything to sneak through.
-   Once the cart is deconstructed, make a carpenter's workshop (on the
    surface or, if things are looking dicey, in the stairwell) from one
    of the logs, then use that to make a wooden hatch from another log.
    Install the hatch over your one-tile, surface-level entrance.
    Congratulations! You now have a lockable front door. It won't stop
    thieves and building destroyers, but at least you can exclude a fair
    bit of dangerous stuff.
-   You'll probably want to forbid the soap so your wasteful dwarves
    don't use it on such frippery as “personal hygiene”. That's for
    hospital use only, Urist!

If you've done all this and your miners still have a long ways to go, by
all means designate a few nearby trees for felling and/or plants for
gathering while you wait, but don't get carried away. You'll want a
small, temporary stockpile nearby for the wood and food.

Soon, however, your miners should be finished with the large 11 x 11
room. Pause the game and fill the room with an “everything stockpile”
for food, cloth, furniture, finished goods, and every other category of
goods you brought with you. Exclude stone (which will just clutter it
up), refuse and corpses (which will cause other objects to decay!).
Remove any temporary stockpiles on the surface (except the corpse/refuse
pile).

Then, in the same room, designate a 3 x 3 pasture and assign your blue
peafowl, to keep them safely inside. It's bad to crowd animals, as they
get aggressive, but unless you brought a bunch more non-grazing animals
this small pasture should be enough. Finally, in the same room,
designate an 8 x 8 zone for a meeting area which does not overlap with
the pasture (again, crowding animals = bad). Idle dwarves will
congregate here, safely underground. You can leave the cat without a
pasture - it should mostly prowl around your stockpiled food, protecting
it from vermin.

Temporarily re-enable hauling labours on your miners so they can help
bring stuff inside, cancel any wood-cutting or plant-gathering
designations, un-forbid the soap, and unpause. Your dwarves should rush
to get everything into the stockpile. When that's done, you can pause
again, re-forbid the soap, and once again disable hauling for your
miners.

Made it!

Of course, things might not have gone to plan. If something arrives at
your fort and either a) it won't go away, so you can't safely access the
surface or b) it's a [Building Destroyer](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Building_Destroyer "wikilink")
and it's coming this way and *oh Armok it's breaking down the hatch…*
you'll have to engineer a more permanent solution. That's beyond the
scope of this guide because it constitutes a fairly substantial
deviation from The Plan, but the most general and powerful approach is
as follows.

First, protect yourself from building destroyers. First, make sure your
dwarves are all inside, then mine away the single up-ramp to the
surface, and replace it with a wall constructed of mining stone (you
should have some by now). Second, you need to engineer
[Cave-in](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Cave-in "wikilink") traps, then lure the thing(s) into them
and activate them. There's [a lot of ways to do this](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Trap_design#cave-in_trap "wikilink") but a word to the wise:
either make it so the traps and fortress access can be activated
remotely, from behind a walled-in fallback position, or *don't bloody
well miss*. Make more and bigger traps than you think you need,
especially if you might only get one shot. Once the dust has settled,
scrape the interloper off the geology and try to pick up where you left
off.

Worst case scenario, if you didn't heed my advice and find yourself in a
location where the surface is chronically unsafe, well, your best bet is
to try to make a home in the caverns and hope your seven dwarves really,
*really* like one another… but that's another section in this guide.
