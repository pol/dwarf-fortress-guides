Embark loadout
--------------

Once you have a good site, it's time to kit out your dwarves. The
loadout below is focused on the equally urgent needs of any early
fortress: security and self-sufficiency. You need to excavate your
fortress, secure its entrance, and obtain sufficient food and drink.
There are a few more long-term considerations as well, particularly as
regards to crucial supplies which are, for one reason or another,
difficult to manufacture early in the game. You have the strangely
specific sum of 1,504 copper [Dwarfbucks](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Currency "wikilink")
(sometimes written as “DB”s or with the symbol “☼”) to allocate between
supplies and skills.

### Supplies

Let's first look at supplies we can do without:

-    You'll only need a single copper battle-axe for your wood cutter,
    so remove one of the defaults
-    Ditch any crafted wood items (buckets, crutches, splints,
    stepladders etc.). These are extremely quick and easy to make.
-   Similarly, remove all quivers. We'll get around to a leather
    industry soon enough.
-   Remove all your pig tail thread, cloth, bags and ropes. Pig tail
    fibre is really expensive! In its place, we'll the cheap stuff: yarn
    (see below)

Many advanced players also like to remove the iron anvil and trade for
one early on. However, making an anvil requires an anvil, and although
you can usually trade for one early enough it's safest to bring your own
rather than rely on this. That way any accident or threat which prevents
you trading won't utterly cripple your metal industry.

Now for some useful items which are somewhat difficult to obtain in
early-game:

-    Take three gypsum plaster, three yarn thread and three yarn cloth
    in case we get unlucky and need emergency supplies for a field
    hospital.
-    Bring four yarn ropes: two for tying up guard dogs, one for
    building a well, and one for making a traction bench (again, for the
    hospital).
-   Bring ten yarn bags for storing seeds; our textile industry will
    take a while to get off the ground.

You'll want some animals, too. Unfortunately, we can't just bring a
single male-female pair of animals we want to breed, because it
*is* possible for animals to be exclusively homosexual or
asexual. We'll need two of each sex for redundancy.

-   Bring two male and two female sheep, both adults. Sheep are the most
    versatile livestock - they don't require a lot of pasture, and they
    are the only starting livestock which can provide wool, milk, meat,
    bone, hide, and horn (llamas and alpacas are similar, but without
    the horn).
-    Similarly, bring two adult male and female war dogs. War dogs serve
    two important functions. First, we will be using them as guard dogs
    to detect and frighten off [thieves](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Thief "wikilink"). Later, when
    a few of their pups have grown, we can train more war dogs and
    assign them to dwarves for protection.
-    Again, take two adult peacocks and peahens. An egg industry is very
    simple and self-contained way to ensure a steady supply of food.
    Blue peafowl are a balanced choice: they live an extremely long time
    so you won't have to worry about replacing them for a while, grow to
    maximum size quickly in case you decide to use excess birds in the
    [Meat industry](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Meat_industry "wikilink"), and have a moderate but
    consistent clutch size. Many [other
    birds](Egg_production#Embark "wikilink") are also perfectly
    appropriate.
-    Bring a single male cat. Cats kill vermin and so protect your food
    stocks. Their population can be [difficult to
    control](Catsplosion "wikilink"), however, so using a tom cat allows
    [gelding](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Gelder "wikilink").

You should have about ☼443 remaining.

### Skills

Now it's time to assign [skills](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Skill "wikilink") to your dwarves,
which will determine which [labours](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Labor "wikilink") they will carry
out in your fortress. The following list covers all the essential core
skills for a self-sufficient fort, and matches them by workload (so a
high-demand job, like masonry, is matched with a seldom-needed job, like
architecture).

-   Two dwarves will get the maximum 5 points of mining skill and
    nothing else. Underground space is a precious commodity in an early
    fort, and you will not be able to spare your miners for other
    labours for some time - especially if you embark with only a thin
    layer of soil, in which case you may soon be cursing every meal,
    siesta and mug of booze that your overworked pick-swingers dare to
    indulge.
-    One dwarf should get 5 points in mechanics and 5 in stonecrafting.
    Your mechanic will construct mechanisms (of course), bridges,
    levers, and traps - all essential in sealing and protecting the
    early fort. Stonecrafting will, among other things, turn abundant
    stone into food storage and trade goods.
-    Another dwarf should get 5 points in masonry and architecture.
    Architecture is used in designing certain buildings - principally,
    for the early game, trade depots, bridges, and wells - and
    well-designed buildings make dwarves happy. In any case, the skill
    is required to build these things, and it's rather difficult to
    train: why not start off Proficient? But this dwarf's main job will
    be masonry. Stone blocks are going to be necessary in great
    abundance for all manner of building projects, as well as sundry
    stone tables, grates, hatches, chairs, doors, and so on.
-    Another dwarf should get 5 points in each of wood cutting and
    carpentry. In the early game, your carpentry needs are, apart from
    some odds and ends, mostly confined to storage bins and cage traps,
    so in fact your carpenter needn't be particularly busy at first. In
    which case, they can spend their time happily wielding the Axe of
    Elvish Irritation and getting as much timber on the ground as
    possible before those blasted tree-huggers can upbraid you for the
    senseless slaughter of nature's precious children, or whatever.
-    Nearly there. Another dwarf should get 5 points in each of
    herbalist and brewer. Although your dwarves absolutely [MUST
    NOT](Thirst "wikilink") run out of booze, for various reasons you
    won't want your brewer working 24/7 at first, so your brewer should
    have a fair bit of time to frolic in the meadows collecting posies
    of amaranths and baskets of apples to supplement your stocks while
    your fortress's farms are coming online.
-    Finally, a dwarf should get 5 points of planter and 5 of cook. Now,
    it'll be a little while before you get farms and a kitchen up and
    running, but it doesn't hurt to have a general oddbody hauling stuff
    hither and thither early in the game. Your herbalist and egg-layers
    should soon supply the ingredients for your kitchen in any case, and
    once the farms come on-line this skill mix represents a good balance
    of labour time. Cooked meals have many benefits - they're worth a
    packet in trade if you can spare them, are easier to store, make
    more things edible, and can add to dwarven happiness.

Once you've assigned all these skills, you should have a few DBs left
over. Go ahead, buy yourself something nice. Don't spend it all in one
place - but I will point out that despite my earlier nonchalance about
victuals, no fortress ever failed by having *too much* food (including
seeds) and booze…

### Other considerations

You'll notice there are no military skills in this list. In a fairly
benign embark, you can usually go at least a year or two without needing
much of a military, and if you *do* attract unwanted attention, then
many of these unpredictable threats are just as likely to eat your
Proficient Axedwarf as they are to succumb to them anyway. That being
the case, this strategy relies on barriers and traps to overcome any
surprise early-game fun. If things go unexpectedly sideways before the
defences are in place, we have some ways of dealing with that in the
next section.

Some of these pairings might not make a lot of sense at first. For
example, why wouldn't you separate your carpentry from your
wood-cutting, so there's a steady stream of wood coming in and products
going out? Because carpentry products aren't actually needed so much
early in the game so it's more important to get trees on the ground, for
later. There are certainly other ways to match labours: for example, any
two of herbalism, cook, planter and brewer should make a pretty
well-balanced division of labour. But the setup given above is a solid
way to make sure your basic needs are met as quickly and efficiently as
possible in the early game. Techniques like giving moodable skills,
raw-material embarks and jump-starting a metal industry are more
advanced.

As for which dwarves are suited for which labour, that's complicated.
Check the dwarves' [Thoughts and
Preferences](Thoughts_and_Preferences "wikilink") pages. If they like a
material or product associated with a particular skill (e.g. oak wood,
mugs, quarry bush leaves) then it's a good bet to match those up. Other
[characteristics](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Personality_trait "wikilink") can also be
[important](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Attributes "wikilink") - you ideally want miners who are
slow to tire, for example. The wiki pages for individual skills list the
attributes they require and train, if you're interested. On the whole,
however, it's not likely to make an enormous difference. By all means
bury yourself in the wiki but if you haven't the patience then nobody
will blame you. I do cover the subject of dwarf management in more
detail later.

So, embark! If you need to, you can save the game when you arrive and
pick it up later.
