The stone industry
------------------

The first and easiest thing is the stone industry (but this is a long
section). Your miners will soon be producing more stone than you can
handle, so when one of the larger rooms in the mid-layer is finished,
build a some relevant workshops and surround them with a stone
stockpile. My preferred layout is as follows:

![](images/3_stone_workshops.png "3_stone_workshops.png")

This diagram shows the upper-left quadrant of the middle layer.

`s` = stone stockpile

`m` = mason's workshop (yes, two - there's a good reason to add extra
masons soon)

`b` = block stockpile

`x` = mechanic's workshop

`r` = craftsdwarf's workshop

Designate the 11 x 11 stone stockpile first, then make 3 x 3 cutouts for
the workshops. Exactly which workshop goes in which 3 x 3 space doesn't
particularly matter, but otherwise it's laid out this way for several
reasons. Placing the stone stockpile right next to the workshops which
use it saves the poor bastards from lugging it all over the map, which
can take forever - set the stockpile to “give” to these four workshops,
so they only use stone from the stockpile. Lugging stone to stockpiles
is faster, because you will now go into stockpile options and assign it
three wheelbarrows. Even so, your craftsdwarves will often use up the
stone faster than it can be hauled, so a large stone stockpile gives you
decent reserves.

### A Subtle Appreciation of Stone

There's a few more changes you need to make (stockpile management is
complex). First, not all stones are appropriate for crafting in these
workshops. Have a look at all the different types of
[Stone](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Stone "wikilink") your miners have encountered, and individually
look them up on the wiki. In addition, read [The Non-Dwarf's Guide to
Rock](The_Non-Dwarf's_Guide_to_Rock "wikilink"). In this stockpile, you
should only enable stones which are present on your map and which
*don't* fall into the following categories (here begins an educational
but brief detour into the subject of satisfying dwarven preferences):

-   [Ore](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Ore "wikilink"): later, we'll smelt these into metal bars
-   [Economic stone](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Economic_stone "wikilink"): this category includes
    [Flux](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Flux "wikilink") stones such as marble (required for making
    steel) and fuel sources such as lignite
-   Stone which is used to make [Gypsum plaster](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Gypsum_plaster "wikilink")
-   “Other Stone” which is too heavy and inefficient to haul: cinnabar,
    pitchblende and cobaltite. Later, we can use these as ammo in
    catapults and stone-fall traps
-   Stones which are otherwise unremarkable (again, under “Other Stone”)
    but which should be reserved for when you have highly-skilled
    craftsdwarves better able to satisfy your citizens'
    [Preferences](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Preference "wikilink"), by two criteria:
    -   Any stone can be a dwarf's favourite, but some are quite rare.
        Anything in the table at [Stone\#OtherStone](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Stone#Other_Stone "wikilink") is [somewhat rare
        ](Vein "wikilink") (not forming entire layers); stones which
        lack a “V” or a “L” in the “Found in” column are particularly
        rare.
    -   Similarly, stones which are both (somewhat) rare and have a rare
        [colour](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Color#Material_By_Color "wikilink"), since dwarves can
        also have a favourite colour. This category includes:
        -   Dark red: Bauxite (large clusters). Colour substitutes
            include kaolinite (but better to use that for porcelain),
            hematite (much more valuable smelted into iron!) and, for
            some items, blood thorn wood (only found in the deepest
            cavern layer)
        -   Red: Petrified wood and realgar, present as small clusters.
            Colour substitutes include cinnabar (moderately abundant in
            veins but impractically dense for general use) and, for some
            items, goblin-cap wood (though only found in the very
            dangerous second and third levels of caverns)
        -   Green: Olivine (large clusters) and serpentine (small
            clusters within olivine). Since these are the same colour,
            best to use the more abundant olivine for satisfying colour
            preferences and save serpentine for the more specific
            material preferences. Colour substitutes include malachite
            (more valuable as an ore of copper) and green glass
            (particularly if you have sand on the map, and even more so
            when you get magma power)
        -   Dark Blue: Kimberlite (veins). Colour substitute for some
            items is nether-cap wood, but only available in the 3rd
            cavern layer
        -   Blue: Cobaltite (veins). Too heavy for general use but
            literally the only straight-blue material in the game.
        -   Purple: Pitchblende (too heavy for general use anyway) and
            rutile (both small clusters). Colour substitutes include
            black bronze, which is more valuable and not otherwise very
            useful, so actually better for satisfying colour
            preferences, and glumprong wood (only found in evil regions
            so, apart perhaps from trade, you shouldn't be going
            anywhere near the stuff)
-   Finally, jet (large clusters). Jet is the *lightest* stone in the
    game, so it's best saved for making lightweight stone pots which
    will be faster to haul about. If you're lucky enough to find it, you
    can make a dedicated stockpile somewhere which gives to a dedicated
    craftsdwarves' workshop and only make your stone pots from this
    workshop. There's a speed benefit to using the jet as soon as you
    find it, but you may also wish to use heavier materials for now and
    save your jet for more skilled craftsdwarves which will be able to
    do the material justice. More mature fortresses with ordinary
    [Clay](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Clay "wikilink") (not fire clay) on the map have an
    alternative, which is to make earthenware pots (essentially the same
    weight); these are more costly to produce, however, since you need a
    potter, a glazer, some glazing material, a pottery kiln, and one
    unit of fuel each for firing the clay and glazing the pot.

Finally, after setting the stockpile options to allow *only* the stones
which are both present on your map and not reserved for any of the uses
described above, open the z-menu, go to “Stone” and disable all “Other
Stone” except the ones allowed in your stockpile.

This seems like an awful lot to think about and a lot of work, I know,
but trust me. For one thing, this is important education in game
mechanics - Dwarf Fortress is a game of *detail*, and although it’s a
lot to take in at once you're going to need to get this fine-grained
sooner or later. Secondly, we can better understand and control the
complex interplay of materials, stockpiles, workshops, products, and
individual dwarven quirks by making each area as specific as possible
and therefore as simple as possible. That means, as a general principle,
it's a lot more work to go through all the menus and individually
*disallow* things you aren't currently using; better to disallow as much
as possible and then individually *allow* things as they become
available/needed. Another reason this approach works well is because of
the sheer amount of z-space you have to play with in Dwarf Fortress.
When you come across a new resource or bring a new part of your industry
online, there's no reason not to set up a dedicated area.

### The Many Uses of Rocks

Alright, back to the diagram. The other stockpile is for blocks, which I
prefer to have close to the central spiral for faster deployment. They
get a smaller pile than stone because, although we need a lot, they can
be stacked fairly efficiently in bins. Again, go into the stockpile
settings and turn off everything except the blocks made of the stones
allowed in your stone stockpile.

For the other products of these workshops, we'll use the layers above
and below. On each of those layers we'll have 1 x large space and 4 x
medium spaces to work with (so 2 + 8). In addition, there's a medium
room in the middle layer across the corridor from the blocks, and two
more at the end of that corridor But what should go where? There's a
confusing diversity of products from the mason's and (in particular) the
craftsdwarf's workshops. Again, our principle should be to disallow
everything, and the allow only what we have and need right now (or in
the near future). Taking that into consideration, here is my recommended
allocation. In this list, “f” denotes a furniture stockpile, and “g” a
finished goods stockpile.

-   Large spaces above and below:
    -   f1: Mechanisms
    -   f2: Large pots
-   Medium spaces above and below:
    -   f3: Less-used barriers (hatch cover, grate, floodgate)
    -   f4: (semi-)Functional furniture (armour stand, weapon stand,
        quern, millstone, traction benches)
    -   f5: Storage (cabinets and coffers i.e. “boxes and bags” in the
        menu)
    -   f6: Dining (tables & chairs i.e. “thrones” in the menu)
    -   f7: Decorations/memorials (statues, slabs, coffins)
    -   g1: Toys
    -   g2: Musical instruments
    -   g3: Crafts for trade goods (figurines, amulets, scepters,
        crowns, rings, earrings, bracelets)
-   Off the hall:
    -   f8: Doors
    -   g4: Mugs i.e. “goblets” in the menu
    -   g5: Tools, which includes nest boxes for now, and eventually
        bookshelves and hives

Aside from the general locations (large 11 x 11 rooms vs. adjoining
medium rooms vs. medium rooms off the corridor), it doesn't particularly
matter exactly which goes where.

These stockpiles cover all the products of the mason's workshop, the
mechanic's workshop, and all the stone items you *should* be producing
from a craftsdwarf's workshop in the short-medium term. There's one
section of the “Finished goods” stockpile in particular which is a bit
of a grab-bag of various classes of objects: [Tools](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Tools "wikilink").
For now, we deal with it by avoiding the manufacture of anything except
a nest box or two. Later, I discuss easy ways of managing this
heterogeneous category by ensuring that different tools are made from
different materials. Finally, in each of the finished goods and
furniture stockpiles, you should disallow all materials other than the
stone(s) permitted in your stone stockpile. Make sure you still allow
all quality levels (both core and total), though!

Efficient placement of [workshops](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Workshop "wikilink") and
[stockpiles](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Stockpile "wikilink") is crucial because your list of jobs
will usually far exceed your available dwarf-power. Logical and
highly-specific compartmentalisation of industry process-chains is also
essential to understand and control what is being produced from what,
and where things are being stored. you should
[read](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Workshop_design "wikilink") about
[this](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Stockpile_design "wikilink").

Don't immediately queue up a bunch of jobs, because we'll need to wait
until the stone stockpile is fairly well-stocked if we're to avoid
running out and the ensuing job cancellations. But once it's pretty
full, here's your list of production priorities:

-   Mason's workshop: four thrones and four tables makes enough dining
    sets to prevent your dwarves getting uppity about having to eat
    standing up (the prima donnas). Then make a stone hatch cover to
    replace the wooden one over your entrance, and set stone blocks on
    repeat. You can never have too many stone blocks, and we'll need a
    lot to build workshops and a more secure fortress entrance
-   Your mechanic's workshop should likewise have mechanisms set on
    repeat. We'll need a fair few for various devices (bridges, wells,
    grates, floodgates) and the levers to operate them. Stop if your
    mechanism stockpile gets full, though - that should be *plenty*.
-   The craftsdwarves' workshops should make about seven stone mugs
    (which your dwarves find preferable to dunking their beards directly
    into a tub of booze, the bourgeoisie swine), a nest box or two for
    your blue peahen to lay eggs, and then have stone pots set on
    repeat - you'll need quite a lot of these. We're substituting them
    as far as possible for barrels, because your supply of wood is more
    limited than stone. Weight-wise, a stone pot weighs 1/4 as much as a
    barrel of the same material and has the same capacity; this makes
    (heavier but abundant) stone an attractive material for containers
    compared to (lighter but less abundant) wood. Monitor your pots
    stockpile - you should maintain a good buffer supply. When it fills
    up, however, you may as well make other goods to start anticipating
    future fortress needs: queue up a few more goblets, some instrument
    parts, some toys (für die kinder, die kleine kinder), and then put
    rock crafts on repeat. Those will use up excess stone and give you
    something to trade when the first caravan arrives - just be sure to
    suspend these jobs whenever they're holding up some other task.

Having tasks set to repeat is not something to be done lightly. Every
item has significant hidden costs - haulage time, storage space,
framerate - so in general it's better to try to roughly estimate needed
quantities and add only a small buffer. I've made an exception for stone
blocks because we're going to need hundreds in short order, and
thousands not long thereafter, so there's no reason to cancel that
particular repeated job. And rock crafts are space-efficient, use up an
incredibly abundant resource, and can be traded for far more useful and
rare items. At any point, however, if your craftsdwarves are being kept
busy in their workshops but you want them to do something else, just
suspend the workshop jobs until they've finished the other work.

What will we need all those stone blocks for? Well, I'll show you:
