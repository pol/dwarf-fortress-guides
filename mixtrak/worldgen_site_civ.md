This first section of the strategy guide covers world generation, site
and civilisation choice, provisioning and skill allotment.

Worldgen, Site and Civilization Choice
--------------------------------------

This step is rather straightforward, and well-covered in the wiki.
First, read the article on basic [World Generation](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/World_Generation "wikilink"). Then, create your world, using
the following settings:

World size | History | Number of Civilisations | Maximum Number of Sites | Number of Beasts | Natural Savagery |  Mineral Occurrence
---------- | ------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------------
Small      | Short   | High                    | Medium                  | Medium           | Medium           | Frequent

This should result in a well-balanced mix of challenge (hostile
civilisations, beasts, savage animals) and opportunity (minerals,
trading civilisations) for the beginning player. The world should also
generate and the game run fairly fast on a variety of machines; note
that these aspects of performance tend to degrade exponentially with
world size and complexity.

You may wish to consult the [Map legend](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Map_legend "wikilink") to
understand the result a bit better. When you're done, hit to save the
world and return to the main menu.

Now that your world is done baking you could, if you desired, dive right
in with [Dwarf fortress mode](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Dwarf_fortress_mode "wikilink"). However,
I prefer to learn a bit more about the various dwarven civilisations
before I choose one to play. If you'd like to do the same, look into installing [DFhack](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Utility:DFHack "wikilink") and using the [Legends
Viewer](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=154617.0) to look at the various civilizations
and their stories.  Note: if you do start a fortress mode game in your new world, you will not
be able to see the legends without abandoning your fortress (the game modes are exclusive). 

Choosing a site
---------------

Once you're ready to choose a civilisation, read some
[advice](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Embark "wikilink") on [Choosing a Good
Site](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Quickstart_guide#Choosing_a_Good_Site "wikilink"). It's worth
taking your time with this! There are a lot of important considerations. 

To search for a site with these characteristics, press `f` (Find Desired Location), with the following options (leave as N/A if not listed):

**Required**

- ⇨ Soil: Some ([for agriculture](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Stone_layers#Soil "wikilink"))
- ⇨ Clay: Yes
- ⇨ Aquifer: No ([useful but complex/dangerous](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Aquifer "wikilink")))
- ⇨ Shallow Metal: Yes ([for metal industry](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Ore "wikilink"))
- ⇨ Flux Stone Layer: Yes ([for iron and steel](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Flux "wikilink"))

**Preferred**

- ⇨ Savagery: Low ([not too dangerous](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Surroundings "wikilink"))
- ⇨ Temperature: Medium ([a moderate temperature](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Biome))
- ⇨ Evil: Low (avoid necromancer's towers for now)
- ⇨ Deep Metal: Yes

If you don't find anything, make a note of what items are showing up in red, and adjust the "Preferred" items above until you find a site.  If you still can't find a site with the Preferred items all set to N/A,  you can either generate a new world, or you can remove a required feature. Playing without a required feature will require being creative and going outside the guide (for example, you will have to trade for clay instead of mining it).

Once you have found a site, there are some additional requirements that will not be covered by the search: 

1. [Trees](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Tree "wikilink"), for carpentry
2. [Flowing water](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/River "wikilink") (stream, brook, or river), for brewing and cleaning
3. (optional) [Sand](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Sand), for glass making. <!-- TODO: Is sand even available on the embark screen? -->

The "High" number of civilizations will almost certainly ensure that you will have access to migrants, visitors, and merchant caravans.
However, it is worth [checking](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Embark#Changing_Views "wikilink") your proximity to your own civilization (if you picked one you liked from Legends mode) just to make sure that it isn't too far away. Otherwise, you can keep the default civilization.
