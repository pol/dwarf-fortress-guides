Welcome to [mixtrak](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/User:Mixtrak "wikilink")'s strategy guide for Dwarf Fortress.

# *Another* one? #

Yes, there are many detailed, comprehensive resources for Dwarf Fortress
on this wiki, and very illustrative video tutorials and playthrough
guides elsewhere. I have relied on [them](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Tutorials "wikilink") extensively (thanks, [Captain
Duck](http://dffd.bay12games.com/file.php?id=10552)!), and so will you -
this strategy guide is not intended to be in any way definitive or a
replacement for other resources. Rather, the intention of this guide is
to be as linear and straightforward as a video walkthrough, while
providing sufficiently detailed context and reasoning that players can
grasp the underlying principles, and generalise them to other contexts.
The intended audience is beginner to intermediate players. Beginner
players usually wish to begin playing immediately, and this guide
provides a structured approach which helps them learn the game.
Intermediate players will understand the basics, but this guide may help
to sort through competing priorities while promoting forward-thinking
development of the fortress.

Philosophy and Contribution
---------------------------

This strategy is as much for myself as for anyone else, as a place to
work out my thoughts and as a reminder when I start a new fortress. It's
therefore unapologetically idiosyncratic and opinionated. That said, I
welcome comments and edits - please feel free to say something on the
“Discussion” pages or, if you think you can improve things, just [be
bold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold) and go ahead and
edit the content page. I can always edit further (or roll back). The
strategy is currently undergoing
[playtesting](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=163161.0),
and will be continually updated. Once it's fairly battle-hardened I'm
hoping to make a video series to complement it.

This strategy asserts that a fairly “nice” location - with good
resources and moderate dangers - is the best way to learn how to manage
a fort. This task is sufficiently complex that you should not want for
additional challenges; the basic gameplay provides quite sufficient
[Fun](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Fun "wikilink") for most beginners.

The main reason to start (relatively) easy is the complexity and
interconnectedness of the different facets of fortress management. An
Overseer must simultaneously manage the security, industry, happiness,
military, economy, administration, diplomacy (and so on) of the
fortress, and do so based on a solid understanding of the underlying
game mechanics. Learning all these things and their interactions at once
is extremely difficult, so do not scoff, overweening, at starting with a
few advantages.

Another courtesy to new players and a side-product of focusing on
fundamentals is that this strategy generally follows the KISS principle.
While there are doubtless more efficient and effective strategies than
covered in this guide, they may be obtuse, have many steps, or require a
simultaneous familiarity with many different industries and gameplay
elements. This guide attempts to gently lead players to that holistic
understanding as the fortress develops.

Finally, this guide is shaped by a strong aesthetic preference for
original-flavour gameplay. There are many third-party tools which
significantly ease the task of fort management, but for whatever reason
I generally prefer the vanilla experience. For me, it's most rewarding
to play Dwarf Fortress more or less “as intended”, and in any case there
are benefits to beginners in terms of getting started faster, focusing
on fundamentals and reducing cognitive load. This also means I *tend* to
avoid exploits or anything which feels a bit cheesy. For better or
worse, you'll find no quantum stockpiles, free containers, or
building-destroyer-pathing exploits here. I also assume that players
wish to experience all aspects of economy and gameplay, including the
potentially inconvenient or inessential elements such as mandates and
using plaster casts.

Content
-------

The focus of this guide is very specifically *strategy*, i.e. “[a high
level plan to achieve one or more goals under conditions of
uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy)”. Strategy is
important because “the resources available to achieve these goals are
usually limited” (ibid.). This describes the situation of a Dwarf
Fortress player very well - a goal (developing the fortress), limited
resources (at embark, seven dwarves, some supplies, and the landscape),
and uncertainty (especially for beginners).

Crucially, this implies that the *reasoning* underlying this guide is
more important than the concrete instructions themselves; accordingly, I
show my “working-out” rather than simply providing answers. Conversely,
the game interface is generally not covered, so players are not walked
through every button-push but rather are directed to the appropriate
resources or expected to look things up on the wiki. It's easy to find
out *how* to catch a fish; rather, this guide instead answers the more
complex question of if and when you *should* catch fish.

Of course, a subtle discussion of each industry is not very helpful to
the beginner player. Beginners haven't developed an internalised model
of the various and context-dependent costs, risks, needs and benefits.
It's impractical to start by providing all the information and then
expect an inexperienced player to put it into practice; there are too
many unfamiliar moving parts to consider at once. It's best to learn the
game elements in a structured manner.

I've therefore tried to derive a very specific strategy which is also as
general and reliable (assuming a “nice” embark) as possible. Consider
this a kind of “worked example”, which should simultaneously get you
playing and help you develop a more flexible understanding of the game
fundamentals. Once familiar with those, you can begin to generalise and
adapt them to more challenging embarks. Indeed, even as a player
progresses through this guide, the rigid prioritisation relaxes and the
servings of information become more like a buffet than a degustation.
When you're ready to go from diner to chef, you've at least partially
outgrown this guide.

On that note, a disclaimer about prescriptivism: as the old Overseer
curse goes, “have fun”. As I've stated, this is a *personal* guide;
there are innumerable ways to play the game, so if you're not enjoying
something, go ahead and do it differently. This guide assumes you want
to produce a secure and durable fortress in which to fully explore the
core game mechanics (military, economy, sociology, exploration etc.),
but some players have more esoteric goals. Whatever powers your
minecart, friend.

Recommended Pre-reading
-----------------------

This guide assumes you already have a general idea of what [Dwarf
Fortress](Dwarf_Fortress "wikilink")
[*is*](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/User:Mixtrak/What_is_Dwarf_Fortress? "wikilink") actually
[About](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/About "wikilink"), and that you've managed to get it
[running](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Installation "wikilink"). In addition, I'd recommend reading,
at minimum, the [Quickstart guide](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Quickstart_guide "wikilink"), but
really any time spent on the wiki is spent well. Don't worry too much
about understanding or retaining things at this stage - this is more by
way of general orientation. You could also consider reading parts of the
[Frequently Asked Questions](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Frequently_Asked_Questions "wikilink")
(particularly the interface, since that won't be covered much in this
guide), and a little more detail about [Dwarf Fortress
Mode](Dwarf_Fortress_Mode "wikilink"), which is what we'll be playing.
It also wouldn't hurt to watch some video tutorials - I highly recommend
the aforementioned series by Captain Duck. Some of the information in
the [Tutorials](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Tutorials "wikilink") may be outdated or contradict the
recommendations in this guide, so don't be confused by the differences.

Strategy Guide Parts
--------------------

[Part 1](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/User:Mixtrak/Strategy/part_1 "wikilink") covers world
generation, choosing a civilisation and site, provisioning your dwarves,
and allocating skills

[Part 2](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/User:Mixtrak/Strategy/part_2 "wikilink") covers the initial
settling-in period at your new map, that is, the mad scurry to get a
door between your dwarves and the wildlife

[Part 3](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/User:Mixtrak/Strategy/part_3 "wikilink") is (currently) very
long indeed, and sets up early security and self-sufficiency.

The next part (in development) will probably cover basic amenities for
your dwarves, trade, and allocation of labours.
