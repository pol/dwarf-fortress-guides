NB: In this section, we talk about ensuring the basic security and
self-sufficiency of your fortress. This is the longest section, because
you simultaneously need to learn about fortress design, resource
management, stone, wood, food, furnaces, stockpiles, workshops, and so

industries, not necessarily in the order they should be pursued, so read
the whole guide to get a sense of how your dwarves should be allocating
their time. Don't worry, other sections should all be more brief!

Ah, excellent! Everything's securely inside, behind a stout wagon-wood
barrier, so it's time for a leisurely exploration of the dwarven
cheese-making industry, no?

Unfortunately, wooden hatches will stop neither troll, nor kobold thief,
nor perhaps even a moderately determined badger. And in fact, we're
swiftly outgrowing doors of any material. Level II building destroyers
like minotaurs enjoy nothing more than a good stone door which they can
gleefully grind to powder and snort, shortly before doing the same to
your dwarves. There is a simple way to make your fortress pretty well
impenetrable, but first it's going to require some workshops, and that
